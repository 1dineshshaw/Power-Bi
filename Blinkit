Project Title: Blinkit Analysis in Power BI

Objective:
Developed a comprehensive data analysis project using Power BI to assess various aspects of sales performance. 
The project aimed to understand the impact of fat content, item type, and outlet characteristics on total sales.

Key Analysis and Visualizations:

Total Sales by Fat Content: Utilized a Donut Chart to analyze how fat content influences total sales,
                          including additional KPIs such as average sales, number of items sold, and average ratings.
Total Sales by Item Type: Employed a Bar Chart to compare the performance of different item types, 
                          analyzing additional metrics to gain deeper insights.
Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales: Used a Stacked Column Chart to compare total sales across outlets
                          segmented by fat content, evaluating additional KPIs to provide a holistic view.
Total Sales by Outlet Establishment: Created a Line Chart to evaluate how different outlet characteristics, 
                          such as age or type, affect total sales.
